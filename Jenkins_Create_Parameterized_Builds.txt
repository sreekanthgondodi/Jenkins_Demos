# *************************************************** Scenario: Jenkins Create Parameterized Builds *************************************************
 
A new DevOps Engineer has joined the team and he will be assigned some Jenkins related tasks. Before that, the team wanted to test a simple parameterized job to understand basic functionality of parameterized builds. He is given a simple parameterized job to build in Jenkins. Please find more details below:

Click on the + button in the top left corner and select option Select port to view on Host 1, enter port 8081 and click on Display Port. You should be able to access the Jenkins login page. Login using user theadmin and Adm!n321 password.

Create a parameterized job which should be named as parameterized-job.

Add a string parameter named Stage; its default value should be Build.

Add a choice parameter named env; its choices should be Development, Staging and Production.

Configure job to execute a shell command, which should echo both parameter values (you are passing in the job).

Build the Jenkins job at least once with choice parameter value Development.

Note:

You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case, please make sure to refresh the UI page.

For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

Solution:

Step 1: Create Parameterized Build
Select port to view on Host 1 and connect to port 8081. Login using the Jenkins admin user and password given in the question
Click New item and in the following screen:
Name: parameterized-job (Keep 'Freestyle Project' as selected) and click Ok
Under General click the option This project is parameterized
This will reveal additional option Add Parameter
Click Add Parameter > String Parameter and input the following values as per question:
Name: Stage
Default Value: Build
Click Add Parameter > Choice Parameter and input the following values as per question:
Name: env
Choices:
Development
Staging
Production
In the Build section below, choose Add build step > Execute shell and input the following values in the command:
echo $Stage $env
Click save

Step 2: Run Parameterized Build
The question expects you to run the parameterized build at least once with a particular value selected for env e.g. Development
Click the newly created job, parameterized-job on the home page and in the following screen click Build Now
You should see a new build starting up on the left lower screen

Verification:
Click that build and click Console Output and verify that the echo command is printing the correct values for env and Stage parameter. You should see something like:
Running as SYSTEM
Building in workspace /var/jenkins_home/workspace/parameterized-job
[parameterized-job] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/jenkins6109190682713673426.sh
+ echo Build Development
Build Development
Finished: SUCCESS
